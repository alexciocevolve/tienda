"""End-to-end tests: the shop as it really runs, over the network.

The rule that makes these different from backend/tests, and it is worth saying out loud:

    NOTHING HERE IMPORTS THE APPLICATION.

No `from app import ...` anywhere. These tests only speak HTTP and SQL, exactly like a
browser and a database client would. A test that imports the code it is testing can pass
while the containers are misconfigured, the migrations never ran, CORS is wrong or the
images are not being served - which is the whole set of things this layer exists to catch.

They run against the DEVELOPMENT database, because that is what the running shop uses. So
they bring their own product and their own customer, and take both away afterwards: the 36
seed products are never touched, and no stock is left changed after a run.
