"""Shared setup for every test.

Two decisions worth reading before the tests themselves:

1. The tests run against a SEPARATE database, shop_test, built by running the real
   migrations. Not against the development database, because a test that empties a table
   must not be able to take the class demo with it; and not against a schema made with
   `Base.metadata.create_all`, because then the migrations would quietly stop being true -
   the thing the tests trust would no longer be the thing production runs.

2. Each test runs inside a transaction that is rolled back afterwards, so every test starts
   from the same 36 products and no users. See the `db` fixture for the one subtlety.
