    # products of 001_products point at an external site (picsum.photos); from now on each
    # one points at its own file, served by this API under /images (see data/images).
    # The value is a path relative to the server, not a full address: the API builds the
    # full URL from the address each request arrived at, so the database does not hard-code
    # a host and the same data works on localhost and in production.
    # The WHERE clause only touches rows still on the old external URL, so a product that
    # someone has already pointed at another image is left alone.
